# Example Outputs

This directory contains example output files that demonstrate the expected output format from the AgentPress system.

## About This Directory
The actual `output/` directory is git-ignored per `.gitignore` to avoid committing generated content. This directory exists as a reference for:

- What output files look like
- Structure of generated content
- Format of JSON output
- Example story formats

## Note
When running the application, output files are generated in the `output/` directory which is automatically excluded from version control.
